Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It‚Äôs also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection‚Äîpotentially aided by data science‚Äîcan make treatment more effective.\nCurrently, dermatologists evaluate every one of a patient‚Äôs moles to identify outlier lesions or ‚Äúugly ducklings‚Äù that are most likely to be melanoma. Existing AI approaches have not adequately considered this clinical frame of reference. Dermatologists could enhance their diagnostic accuracy if detection algorithms take into account ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù images within the same patient to determine which images represent a melanoma. If successful, classifiers would be more accurate and could better support dermatological clinic work.\nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)‚Äôs mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis. The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality-controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions.\nIn this competition, you‚Äôll identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, you‚Äôll use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. Using patient-level contextual information may help the development of image analysis tools, which could better support clinical dermatologists.\nMelanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists‚Äô diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.\nüîç Evaluation Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\nWhat is AUC - ROC Curve?\nAUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. By analogy, Higher the AUC, better the model is at distinguishing between patients with disease and no disease.\nThe ROC curve is plotted with TPR against the FPR where TPR is on y-axis and FPR is on the x-axis.\n‚ñ∂ Here is the link to a great video on roc-auc\nüìù More About Melanoma The most serious type of skin cancer. Melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells that give colour to the skin become cancerous. Symptoms might include a new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole. Melanomas can occur anywhere on the body. Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, medication or in some cases, chemotherapy. Melanoma Hair Remove Kaggle Notebook (120+ ‚≠ê)\nThere are many images with body hair covering the lesion so, hair remove operation can be useful for model focus on lesion part.\nMethod for hair remove using CV2\ndef hair_remove(image): # convert image to grayScale grayScale = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY) # kernel for morphologyEx kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(1,(17,17)) # apply MORPH_BLACKHAT to grayScale image blackhat = cv2.morphologyEx(grayScale, cv2.MORPH_BLACKHAT, kernel) # apply thresholding to blackhat _,threshold = cv2.threshold(blackhat,10,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY) # inpaint with original image and threshold image final_image = cv2.inpaint(image,threshold,1,cv2.INPAINT_TELEA) return final_image results of above mention method Visualizing all CV2 Operations ‚úî ABCDE Rule Use the ‚ÄúABCDE rule‚Äù to look for some of the common signs of melanoma, one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer:\n‚úî Ugly Duckling The Ugly Duckling is another warning sign of melanoma. This recognition strategy is based on the concept that most normal moles on your body resemble one another, while melanomas stand out like ugly ducklings in comparison. This highlights the importance of not just checking for irregularities, but also comparing any suspicious spot to surrounding moles to determine whether it looks different from its neighbours. These ugly duckling lesions or outlier lesions can be larger, smaller, lighter or darker, compared to surrounding moles. Also, isolated lesions without any surrounding moles for comparison are considered ugly ducklings.\nMelanomas commonly appear on the legs of women, and the number one place they develop on men is the trunk.\nMany other factors also play a role in increasing ‚Ä¶","date":1632182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632182400,"objectID":"6de37cd39a6ac667969854a2dba0fa5f","permalink":"https://vatsalparsaniya.github.io/project/kaggle_siim_isic_melanoma_classification/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/kaggle_siim_isic_melanoma_classification/","section":"project","summary":"This contains work on a Medical Image Classification Challenge hosted on Kaggle and secured 127th rank out of 3,308 teams and a silver medal ü•à in this competition.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"SIIM ISIC Melanoma Classification","type":"project"},{"authors":["Vatsal Parsaniya","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
